# DF Mining Movement

I was bored one night while playing dwarf fortress and became mesmerized by the way dwarves moved around the world when they mine. This is a feeble attempt at recreating that behavior.

This project uses react because that was the tool that allowed me to get something on the screen the fastest.

It's super buggy btw.

## Running

- Clone this project
- `yarn`
- `yarn start`

There's not much more to it...
